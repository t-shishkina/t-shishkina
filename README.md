**Senior Product Marketing Manager | GTM Strategist | AI-Native**

I am a Product Marketing leader with over a decade of experience at the intersection of hybrid cloud and AI infrastructure (HPE). My expertise lies in taking complex, high-scale technology and building the narratives and systems that drive market adoption.

I believe that at its best, Product Marketing is a bridge—connecting engineering excellence with customer-centric value.

### ⚡ Beyond the Resume

* **Low Latency:** I optimize marketing processes like I optimize my daily schedule—minimum fluff, maximum output.
* **Postgres Fan:** I appreciate a well-structured database almost as much as a well-structured GTM plan.
* **Remote Veteran:** I've been working in distributed teams since 2020 and believe it’s the best way to build global products.

### 🔭 Experience Note

I spent 10+ years at **Hewlett Packard Enterprise**, where I led marketing operations for cloud services (PaaS/IaaS). I am now focused on bringing that enterprise-scale knowledge to the fast-moving world of developer-first platforms. I'm currently migrating my technical writing archive (including deep-dives on Hybrid Cloud and PaaS) to this profile. Stay tuned.

**Why GitHub?** I believe the best marketing happens where the developers are. I use this space to host my technical writing archives, version-control my strategy notes, and stay close to the developer experience.
